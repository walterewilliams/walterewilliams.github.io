    <p align="left">Prior to the 1930s, Germany was Europe's most hospitable country 
      for Jews. While Jews were only one percent of the population, they were 
      one-fourth of Germany's law and medical students. In some German cities, 
      Jews were the majority of doctors. While Jews were only five percent of 
      the Berlin population in 1905, they paid 31 percent of all income taxes 
      collected. For Germany as a whole, Jewish income was more than three times 
      the national average. In his book, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Migration 
      and Cultures</SPAN>, Dr. Thomas Sowell adds that Jews were so highly integrated 
      into German economic and social life that in nearly half of all Jewish marriages 
      during the 1920s one of the spouses was Gentile. During World War I, Jewish-American 
      publications were investigated and prosecuted by the U.S. Government for 
      writing favorably about Germany, a nation at war with the U.S. </p>

</P>
<P align="left"> Much of German history has been one of racial toleration. This 
  is partially seen by their anti-slavery positions in Brazil and the United States. 
  In the United States, Germans had a large hand in assisting runaway slaves by 
  way of the "underground railroad." Germans also had an established reputation 
  of getting along very well with American Indians.</P>
<P align="left"> So why the story about pre-Nazi Germany? I think examining it 
  raises an interesting question that few bother to answer; namely, if Germany 
  was so hospitable to Jews, relative to other countries, how in the world did 
  the Holocaust happen? There are several alternative explanations such as Hitler's 
  massive consolidation of government power. Then there's the fact that German 
  culture places high values on regimentation and obedience to authority. An important 
  part of the answer of how Germans came to accept Jewish persecution was a massive 
  and successful Nazi Jewish vilification program. Germans being taught to think 
  of Jews as inferiors and as people responsible for the post-World War I economic 
  devastation made it possible for public acceptance of Jewish mistreatment.</P>
<P align="left"> You say, "Okay, you're right but what's the relevance to us?" 
  There are about 40 million Americans who smoke cigarettes. Prior to the 1980s, 
  all efforts to curb tobacco use relied on arguments pertaining to the health 
  risks borne by smokers. The only way to achieve today's level of sustained attack 
  on smokers and tobacco companies was to be able to create an argument that tobacco 
  smoke harmed not only smokers but others as well. Through a fraudulent EPA secondhand 
  smoke study, "Respiratory Health Effects of Passive Smoking," we have produced 
  today's tobacco regulations. That's even in the face of devastating evidence 
  that EPA's secondhand smoke study made subjective judgements, failed to account 
  for important factors that could bias the results, and relaxed a crucial scientific 
  standard to achieve the result the study was looking for. The "relaxed" scientific 
  standard was the EPA's lowering of the confidence interval applied to its analysis 
  from the more standard 95% to 90% - in effect doubling the chance of error. 
  A federal court in <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Flue-Cured Tobacco 
  Cooperative Stabilization Corporation v. EPA</SPAN> added that the EPA: "disregarded 
  information and made findings based on selective information . . . ; deviated 
  from its risk assessment guidelines; failed to disclose important [opposition] 
  findings and reasoning; and left significant questions without answers." </P>
<P align="left"> As a result of both official and non-official fraudulent claims 
  about the health effects, as well as the health care costs of smoking, there 
  has been widely successful vilification of cigarette smokers and tobacco manufacturers. 
  Lawmakers have little hesitance in imposing confiscatory tobacco taxes, in some 
  jurisdictions one to three dollars per pack. Zealous lawmakers and other public 
  officials have attempted to ban smoking on streets and parks. In at least a 
  couple of jurisdictions there have been attempts to outlaw smoking in one's 
  own home or apartment under the flimflam reasoning that neighbors are injured 
  by secondhand smoke. Americans don't mind it at all to see their fellow Americans 
  huddled in the winter outside of their workplaces in order to have a cigarette. 
  In the state of Washington, a condemned prisoner was denied a last request for 
  a cigarette. Last summer, California banned smoking in some of its prisons.</P>
<P align="left"> During a much more civilized era in our country, none of this 
  could have happened. Nazi-like vilification tactics had to be employed whereby 
  decent Americans were convinced that both smokers and tobacco companies are 
  two groups of people deserving of any treatment.</P>
<P align="left"> I'm by no means suggesting that smokers are headed off to concentration 
  camps and gas chambers, although they might have in Germany because Hitler was 
  a rabid anti-cigarette zealot. Instead, I'm suggesting that the cigarette smoker 
  vilification campaign is something about which we all should be concerned, whether 
  we smoke cigarettes or not. These people who want to control our lives are almost 
  finished with smokers; but never in history has a tyrant arisen one day and 
  decided to tyrannize no more. The nation's tyrants have now turned their attention 
  to the vilification of fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's 
  and Kentucky Fried Chicken, charging them with having created an addiction to 
  fatty foods. Thus, the tyrants claim, fast food chains have contributed to obesity-related 
  problems and growing healthcare costs. Like the anti-tobacco zealots they call 
  for regulation, compensation for injury and taxes on foods they deem to be non-nutritious. 
  In addition to fast food chains, these tyrants have targeted soft drink and 
  candy manufacturers. Chinese and Mexican restaurants are also in their sights 
  because they have meal servings deemed to be too large. In their campaign against 
  fast food chains, restaurants and soda and candy manufacturers the nation's 
  food Nazis always refer to the anti-tobacco campaign as the model for their 
  agenda.</P>
