<P>	According to a new book, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The U.S. Organ Procurement System</SPAN>,

written by economists David Kaserman and A. H. Barnett, there are

80,000 Americans on the organ transplant waiting list.  Twenty of

them die each day as a direct result of organ shortages; that's over

7,000 each year.  These lost lives are not so much an act of God as

they are an act of Congress because of its 1984 National Organ

Transplant Act, that prohibits payment to organ donors.  Reliance on

voluntary donations, has been an abject policy failure.  It's

noteworthy that everyone else involved in the organ transplant

business is rewarded handsomely - that includes surgeons, nurses and

organ procurement workers.</P>



<P>	How might an organ transplant market work?  Lloyd Cohen, a law

professor at George Mason University, envisions letting people

contract in advance to permit the harvesting of any usable organs

when they die.  The money earned would become a part of their

estate.  Many people are offended by the notion of human body parts

becoming commodities for sale.  There's at least a tiny bit of

inconsistency because there is a market for human blood, semen and

hair.</P>



<P>	How many vital things in our lives do we depend on altruism or

voluntary donations to provide?  Food is vital, water is vital; so

are clothing and housing.  We don't depend on altruism and voluntary

donations to provide these goods.  And for good reason - there'd be

massive shortages.  Why should we depend on altruism or voluntary

donations to provide what we may one day need more urgently than

food, water, clothing or housing?  All objections to organ sales

reduce to either nonsense, ignorance or arrogance.  Let's look at

some of them.</P>



<P>	One concern is that if organs are sold rather donated, poor

people couldn't afford them.  There's a difference between methods

of attaining organs and methods of distributing them.  For example,

poor people need food but Congress hasn't mandated that food prices

be zero so that poor people can eat.  If Congress did that, there'd

be massive shortages and poor people would probably starve.  Instead

of such a stupid policy, we simply allow the market mechanism to

supply food and then subsidize purchases, through programs like food

stamps.  That same principle can be applied to organ transplants -

allow the market to supply organs and if needed subsidize or provide

through charity their distribution.</P>



<P>	Won't organs be very costly?  Kaserman and Barnett and others

estimate that the organ shortage would be resolved at a prices of

$1,000 to $3,000 per donor.  To the extent that markets would

eliminate organ shortages, it would significantly reduce health care

costs.  For example, the cost of kidney dialysis is about $44,000

per year.  The cost of kidney transplant and medical care for the

first year is about $90,000.  After the first year, medical treatments, mostly for immunosuppressant drugs to prevent rejection are

$16,000.  That means after about two and a half years transplants

save the medical system $27,000 per year as opposed to patients

remaining on long term dialysis.</P>



<P>	Another concern is that if there's a market for organs, poor

people will sell their organs and become ill.  The proposals made so

far provide monetary payments be made for only cadaver organs.  But

from a strictly ethical point of view, people should be able to

dispose of their organs for whatever reason they please.  Why?  If

we agree that people have property rights in themselves, i.e., own

themselves, they have a right to dispose of themselves anyway they

please so long as they do not violate the property rights of others.

I would surely prefer a person who might be unwilling to give me his

kidney find motivation to sell me his kidney rather than for me to

do without.</P>



<P>	Some people have argued that an organ transplant market will

lead to murder and the sale of the victim's organs to unscrupulous

organ brokers.  Murder will remain illegal and punishable.  However,

when the sale of a commodity is illegal there's a heightened potential for illegal activity and concomitant social disorder.  During

Prohibition there was far more criminal activity associated with

alcohol manufacture, distribution and consumption than there is now.

To the extent that prohibition of organ sales reduces their supply,

holding all else equal there's greater incentive for illegal activities involving organ transplants, including murder.</P>



<P>	The medical profession has traditionally been opposed to organ

sales.  Their opposition would seem to be in violation of Hippocrates' admonition - primum non nocere.  But they've recently taken

steps, all be they timid, towards ending the day to day deaths due

to organ shortages.  At their July 2002 meeting, the American

Medical Association voted agreement to commence trials in which

payments will be made to organ donors or their families as a means

to encourage cadaveric organ collections. </P>
