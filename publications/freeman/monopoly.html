<P align="center"> <font size="4"><b>Is Monopoly Good or Bad?</b></font></P>



<P> Monopoly is nearly always seen as something undesirable. Courts have wrestled

  with monopoly for ages, sometimes defining it as: "the power to control prices

  and exclude competition", "restraining trade", or "unfair and anti-competitive

  behavior." Should monopolistic practices be condemned and outlawed? Let's look

  at anti-competitive behavior and practices, but let's not confine ourselves

  to what's traditionally seen as monopoly.</P>



<P>     The marriage contract is essentially a monopoly document.

It represents a legally sanctioned collusive agreement between

two parties to exclude competitors and restrain trade.  It closes

the market to competition, or at least it is supposed to.  This

collusion has benefits as well as costs.  Because I have

exclusive rights to her affections and property rights to a

stream of highly valued domestic services, I place a higher value

on my spouse, making me willing to share with her a greater

percentage of my wealth.  My spouse receives a comparable set of

benefits from this collusive arrangement.</P>



<P>     This monopolistic arrangement has a cost side and perhaps

some inefficiencies as well.  Neither one of us is as attentive

as we were before we made our contractual arrangement.  For my

part, I don't open the car door for her as often, don't use

breath fresheners and colognes as frequently, am not as nearly

considerate and gentlemanly as before our marriage some 42 years

earlier.  The reason is simply that before marriage I was

competing against other men and therefore could ill afford to act

as a monopolist.</P>



<P>     Read the Old Testament's Book of Deuteronomy, Chapter 5,

where God gave Moses the Ten Commandments.  The first

commandment, and presumably the most important is, "Thou Shalt

have none other gods before me."  The second is, "Thou shalt not

make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is

in heaven above. . . ."  Then there's, "Thou shalt not bow down

thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a

jealous God. . . ."  If a corporation made a similar decree

regarding its services, it would find itself in the sights of the

U.S. Department of Justice for gross violations of the anti-trust

provisions of the Sherman and Clayton Acts.  The Ten Commandments

decree exclusive dealing and mandate neither substitutes for nor

competition with God.</P>



<P>     In order for one to condemn all monopolistic practices as

evil, at least for consistency, he would have to also condemn

marriage and the basic tenets of Christianity.  I neither condemn

marriage, the monopolistic tenets of Christianity, nor do I

condemn business and labor union monopolies.  The only moral

argument that can be used to condemn and outlaw monopoly is when

it is created through fraud, threats, intimidation and coercion.</P>



<P> Our nation has a number of government-sponsored, created or protected monopolies

  and collusions in restraint of trade. One of the more egregious examples is

  the U.S. Postal Service. The federal Private Express Statutes, Sec. 310.2 "Unlawful

  carriage of letters," says, "(a) It is generally unlawful under the Private

  Express Statutes for any person other than the Postal Service in any manner

  to send or carry a letter on a post route or in any manner to cause or assist

  such activity. Violation may result in injunction, fine or imprisonment or both

  and payment of postage lost as a result of the illegal activity." The Private

  Express Statutes have the full effect of saying, "Thou shalt have none other

  deliverers of first-class mail before the USPS and we shall visit great pain

  on he who disobeys this commandment." </P>



<P> The U.S. Postal Service is a government-owned monopoly; how ever, there are

  numerous privately-owned monopolies and collusions in restraint of trade. In

  fact, nearly every federal agency is an enforcer of monopolistic collusive agreements.

  Until relatively recently, the Civil Aviation Bureau (CAB) and the Interstate

  Commerce Commission (ICC) enforced price-fixing agreements in the airline and

  trucking industries. Deregulation brought an end to those collusive agreements.</P>



<P>     Thriving monopolistic agreements, at the federal level, are

enforced by agencies such as the U.S. Department of Labor,

National Labor Relations Board, Department of Agriculture,

Federal Communications Commission, Department of Education, and

Department of Commerce.  The rule of thumb to determine whether

an effective collusion exists is to see whether there are:

mandated minimum prices, license to practice provisions and other

restrictions on entry and finally whether there are techniques to

enforce compliance among the colluding members - such as

revocation of license or permit to practice, fines and

imprisonment and other sanctions.</P>



<P>     The free market, including free international trade, is the

most effective protection against monopolistic abuses.  In fact,

in a free and open market, monopolistic companies can retain

their monopoly power only if they do not fully exploit it;

otherwise other companies will enter.</P>
