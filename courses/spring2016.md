The following represents both an approximation of our schedule and the minimum reading requirements for the semester.  There will be two or three problem sets, a mid-term and final examination.  In addition there will be periodic unannounced quizzes consisting of true/false and multiple choice questions.  Therefore, for each class you should bring a No. 2 pencil and a Scantron.

Your final grade will be based upon performance on problem sets (15%), midterm examination (30%), final examination (45%), and unannounced quizzes (10%).
